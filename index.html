WHAT THE...
	usperf's goal is to make it possible to read the hardware performance
	counters used by the perf events linux subsystem from userspace using
	RDPMC instruction avoiding system calls which are too expensive for
	certain tasks like real time performance monitoring, which is exactly what
	libusperf is for.


STATUS
	Linux kernel needs to be patched, see KERNEL PATCH.

	libusperf userspace library is in alpha stage and ready for testing. 


HOW IT WORKS
	1) create hardware perf event (counter) through system call 
	2) mmap the perf event (file descriptor) to get info about the event
	3) continually read the HW counter associated with perf event from
	   userspace using RDPMC


THE PROBLEM
	Context/CPU switches are not yet compensated! This is the main problem
	that needs to be solved.


KERNEL PATCH
	Linux kernel (as of 2.6.39) needs to be patched to:
		- Allow RDPMC instrution from userspace. This is done by setting
		  CR4.PCE CPU flag on x86 which is unset by default allowing RDPMC to
		  be called only from ring 0
		- Get the HW counter index for RPDMC. That is achieved by making
		  perf_event_index() a struct pmu (== arch specific) function. 
	
	Patches to do so are available in kernel-patch/ directory. Patches are
	small but tested to work on x86 only. If you have a powerpc/arm machine
	you'd like to use, please DO let me know!


PREREQUISITIES/INSTALLATION
	You need a machine with PMC, which are present on most of new intel/AMD
	(power/arm too, of course) CPUs. Then you need a linux kernel with perf
	events subsystem and patches applied (see KERNEL PATCH above). 

	Even though you can copy and use {us,}perf.[ch], using library is
	recommended.  Use either the libusperf RPM package or run `make` and copy
	libusperf.so to library dir (and optionally usperf.h to include dir).  

	To check if everything is working, compile tests `make tests` and run
	`./tests_run.sh` in ./tests/ directory to run all usperf tests on all CPUs.


USAGE
	USPERF_* macros are just macros wrapped around usperf_* functions with the
	same parameters that are only enabled when USPERF symbol is defined.
	Additionaly USPERF_*_S macros allow you to ommit passing struct usperf_s as
	the 1st argument and instead use predefined one. This is, as you certainly
	guessed, not a good idea with more than one thread. Basically, your
	measured code will look like this:

	#include &lt;usperf.h&gt;
	...
	...
	struct usperf_s usperf;
	USPERF_INIT(&amp;usperf, N_POINTS, COUNTER_TYPE);
	...
	PERFPOINT(&amp;usperf, 1);
	...
	PERFPOINT(&amp;usperf, 2);
	...
	...
	...
	PERFPOINT($usperf, N - 1)

	USPERF_PRINT(...)
	USPERF_CLOSE(&amp;usperf)

	Make sure libusperf.so is in place and compile with -lusperf and -DUSPERF.
	Without USPERF defined, all the USPERF_* macros shall be disabled, which
	allow you to efficiently enable and disable usperf at compile time.
	Disabling it may cause safe-to-ignore "unused..." compiler warnings.


PRETTY GRAPHICAL OUTPUT
	Indeed! Use USPERF_PRINT() with USPERF_PRINT_DOT format and file stream.
	Output will be generated in dot format. dot is a nice little directed
	graph plotting app from graphviz package and can be:

		viewed with imagemagick: dot -T png usperf.dot | display
		          saved to file: dot -T png -o pretty_graph.png usperf.dot
	
	Line width is proportional to the number of runs through the edge, color
	represents how long it took on average.
